This is my solution to challenges 

Diff Two Arrays 
---------------------
Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays,
but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

Where art thou 
---------------------
Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching property and value pairs (second argument). Each property and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.
For example, if the first argument is [{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], and the second argument is { last: "Capulet" }, then you must return the third object from the array (the first argument), because it contains the property and it's value, that was passed on as the second argument.

Search and Replace
---------------------
Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence.
First argument is the sentence to perform the search and replace on.
Second argument is the word that you will be replacing (before).
Third argument is what you will be replacing the second argument with (after).
NOTE: Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word "Book" with the word "dog", it should be replaced as "Dog"

DNA Pairing
---------------------
The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array.
Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character.
Return the provided character as the first element in each array.
For example, for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"],["G", "C"]]
The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.

Pig Latin
--------------------
Translate the provided string to pig latin.
Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay".
If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end.
